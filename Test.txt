Archibald Joseph Cronin (Cronogue) (19 July 1896 â€“ 6 January 1981) was a Scottish physician and novelist.
His best-known novel is The Citadel (1937), about a Scottish physician who serves in a Welsh mining village before achieving success in London, where he becomes disillusioned about the venality and incompetence of some doctors. Cronin knew both areas, as a medical inspector of mines and as a physician in Harley Street.
